    <h1>Review of the Web</h1>
    <p>The internet has become a big part of today's society. I would say the internet has almost become a tool that you can use in so many ways. For example, people use the internet to find out information or entertain themselves. I have used the internet for many years and I would say that it has taught me so many things in life. I think that without having the web I wouldnâ€™t be the person that I am today. As I have gotten older I have realized that I have implemented the web more into my life. Although the internet can be used as a helpful tool to find out the answer to the problem you are facing. It can also be used as a toxic tool to cause harm to someone. Many internet users have used the web to cause harm to people or communities. Overall, the web is a powerful tool that can help anyone in their daily life.</p>

    <h2>Overall score of the web: 8/10</h2>
