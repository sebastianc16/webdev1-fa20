    <h1>About the Jordan 11 Bred</h1>
    <P> The Air Jordan 11 Retro 'Bred' 2019 features a classic Chicago Bulls look. The shoe's upper is built with a mix of mesh and patent leather, all finished in black, save for the Varsity Red Jumpman and white '23.' Underfoot, a contrasting white midsole houses Air and a midfoot plate, while a Varsity Red rubber outsole provides traction and completes the look.</P>
