    <h1>Sean Wotherpoon</h1>
    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>The designer of one of the most popular sneakers of 2018, the Nike Air Max 97/1, Sean Wotherspoon is now one of the most famous sneakerheads on the planet. His Air Max 97/1 is highly sought-after, but it wouldn’t exist without all the work Wotherspoon put in before getting a chance to design with Nike. One of the founders of Round Two, a vintage sneaker store, Wotherspoon was just 23 when he got into the business, but in just a few years, it’s taken off dramatically. Round Two now has a second location, and Wotherspoon and his business partner Chris Russow developed their own autobiographical YouTube show in 2015 to showcase and wear the rare sneakers they’ve collected. He’s one of the foremost sneaker collectors and new designers in footwear.</p>
